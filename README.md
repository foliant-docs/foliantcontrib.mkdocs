# MkDocs Backend for Foliant

![MkDocs site built with Foliant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.mkdocs/master/img/mkdocs.png)

MkDocs backend lets you build websites from Foliant projects using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) static site generator.

The backend adds three targets: `mkdocs`, `site`, and `ghp`. The first one converts a Foliant project into a MkDocs project without building any html files. The second one builds a standalone website. The last one deploys the website to GitHub Pages.


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install foliantcontrib.mkdocs
```


## Usage

Convert Foliant project to MkDocs:

```bash
$ foliant make mkdocs -p my-project
✔ Parsing config
✔ Applying preprocessor mkdocs
✔ Making mkdocs with MkDocs
─────────────────────
Result: My_Project-2017-12-04.mkdocs.src
```

Build a standalone website:

```bash
$ foliant make site -p my-project
✔ Parsing config
✔ Applying preprocessor mkdocs
✔ Making site with MkDocs
─────────────────────
Result: My_Project-2017-12-04.mkdocs
```

Deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
$ foliant make ghp -p my-project
✔ Parsing config
✔ Applying preprocessor mkdocs
✔ Making ghp with MkDocs
─────────────────────
Result: https://account-name.github.io/my-project/
```


## Config

You don't have to put anything in the config to use MkDocs backend. If it's installed, Foliant detects it.

To customize the output, use options in `backend_config.mkdocs` section:

```yaml
backend_config:
  mkdocs:
    mkdocs_path: mkdocs
    slug: my_awesome_project
    use_title: true
    use_chapters: true
    use_headings: true
    default_subsection_title: Expand
    mkdocs.yml:
      site_name: Custom Title
      site_url: http://example.com
      site_author: John Smith
```

`mkdocs_path`
:   Path to the MkDocs executable. By default, `mkdocs` command is run, which implies it's somewhere in your `PATH`.

`slug`
:   Result directory name without suffix (e.g. `.mkdocs`). Overrides top-level config option `slug`.

`use_title`
:   If `true`, use `title` value from `foliant.yml` as `site_name` in `mkdocs.yml`. It this case, you don't have to specify `site_name` in `mkdocs.yml` section. If you do, the value from `mkdocs.yml` section has higher priority.

    If `false`, you *must* specify `site_name` manually, otherwise MkDocs will not be able to build the site.

    Default is `true`.

`use_chapters`
:   Similar to `use_title`, but for `pages`. If `true`, `chapters` value from `foliant.yml` is used as `pages` in `mkdocs.yml`.

`use_headings`
:   If `true`, the resulting data of `pages` section in `mkdocs.yml` will be updated with the content of top-level headings of source Markdown files.

`default_subsection_title`
:   Default title of a subsection, i.e. a group of nested chapters, in case the title is specified as an empty string. If `default_subsection_title` is not set in the config, **…** will be used.

`mkdocs.yml`
:   Params to be copied into `mkdocs.yml` file. The params are passed “as is,” so you should consult with the [MkDocs configuration docs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/).


## Preprocessor

MkDocs backend ships with a preprocessor that transforms a Foliant project into a MkDocs one. Basically, `foliant make mkdocs` just applies the preprocessor.

The preprocessor is invoked automatically when you run MkDocs backend, so you don't have to add it in `preprocessors` section manually.

However, it's just a regular preprocessor like any other, so you can call it manually if necessary:

```yaml
preprocessors:
  - mkdocs:
      mkdocs_project_dir_name: mkdocs
```

`mkdocs_project_dir_name`
:   Name of the directory for the generated MkDocs project within the tmp directory.


## Troubleshooting

### Fenced Code Is Not Rendered in List Items or Blockquotes

MkDocs can't handle fenced code blocks in blockquotes or list items due to an [issue in Python Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/53).

Unfortunately, nothing can be done about it, either on MkDocs's or Foliant's part. As a workaround, use [indented code blocks](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode).


### Paragraphs Inside List Items Are Rendered on the Root Level

Check if you use **four-space indentation**. [Python Markdown is stern about this point](https://python-markdown.github.io/#differences).
